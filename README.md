# BONES-Consultancy
This depository is to show how I would act as if I was a consultant for my favorite rapper BONES and I was picking the playlist for the next show. I don't know the first thing to making music nor do I pretend to be an expert. This is all based on my own personal playlist. BONES will do what BONES does. My goal is to bring the most amount of hype and energy, while including tracks that showcase the emotional side that also serve as rest ("that singing pussy shit").

Some definitions would be good, so first, we are working off of the dataframe that's retrieved by the Spotify API.

Danceability: whatever silly metric Spotify describes as a combo of tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

Energy: 0.0 to 1.0, represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. It's no wonder PullTheSkyDown is 4th in my playlist, as the break down towards the middle of the song pulls the first portion up by the bootstraps

Instrumentalness: 0.0 to 1.0, closer to 1.0 means no instruments

Liveness: Predicts whether or not the track was recorded live

Loudness: -60 to 0 db, based on how loud a song is. In my playlist, 281-330-8004 is the loudest while Espadrilles is the quietest BONES song. 

Speechiness: 0 to 1, closer to 1 the more it's like a talk show, poetry, etc.

Valence: 0 to 1, closer to 1 the more happy it is

Tempo: the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration
