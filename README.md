# BONES Consultancy: Project Overview
* Act as a consultant for a musician with an extensive album collection to choose additional songs for upcoming shows
* Pull data from Spotify's API and get a sense of the data
* Employ two models: Multi-Linear Regression and Logistic Regression to see what is possible and work through errors that might occur for further prediction
* Place favorites of the selected into a playlist

## Spotify API scrape and Youtube data collection

Found a way to pull data about songs out of Spotify. The variables that we work on are:

* danceability
* energy
* key
* loudness
* mode
* speechiness
* acousticness
* instrumentalness
* liveness
* valence
* tempo
* duration
* time_signature

From there, I went to youtube and found shows that BONES performed at and included another column with binary values that state whether or not a song was played at his shows. I pulled in about 2 sets worth, so future iterations would benefit from finding more songs. Binary dependent variables typically benefit from models like Logistic Regression; future analysis might benefit from Random Forest, Neural Networks. For future ideas, it would be good to pull in the number of times each of his songs have been listened to and suggest based off of that. 

## Multi-Linear Regression

### Assumptions Check

* Normal Distribution: Used Shapiro-Wilks, energy is the only normally distributed value
* Multi-Collinearity: No signs using car::vif functionality
* We will run through the model for verification of linear relationship

### Model analysis

There isn't much statistical significance in the variables besides danceability, which is highly significant.


## Logistic Regression

### Model analysis

Not much to write home about with the statistical significance here. Our confusion matrix also just points out to us that there are 199 true positives, 9 false positives, and 1 false negatives. The MLR performed much stronger than this set. 

After throwing y_pred values into a spreadsheet to assess what songs were being recommended, it seems that the algorithm is choosing the longest songs, so this needs to be removed from our model and re-trained.

## Redo

### Multiple Linear Regression

After removing duration_ms and time_signature we get:

With these being the particular songs our better performing algorithm is recommending:

## Final thoughts

This analysis isn't complete without listening to the songs ourselves. 73rdAnnualGimbleTelathon is a misnomer it seems, but the top 10 are solid songs to include in the next show. They achieve either the hype, or the low atmospheric beat that we were searching for. 


The ways that I would improve these models would be to find more instances of songs that were used at his shows. Another way of full improvement is to wrap all of this into python, or all into R with Jupyter notebooks being written in R. 

I put my favorite of the list in a spotify playlist if you're interested in checking them out. Pretty good if you need to zone in!

### To do
# See if data exists to pull in number of listens for all Bones songs, match from our prior analysis to these.
# Make a tableau dashboard for easy visualizations 
# Redo the entire project using git commands
