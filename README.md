# BONES-Consultancy
This depository is to show how I would act as if I was a consultant for my favorite rapper BONES. I want to showcase the best songs to have the most fun. I don't know the first thing to making music nor do I pretend to be an expert. This is all based on my own personal playlist. BONES will do what BONES does.

Some definitions would be good, so first, we are working off of the dataframe that's retrieved by the Spotify API.

Danceability: whatever silly metric Spotify describes as a combo of tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

Energy: 0.0 to 1.0, represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. It's no wonder PullTheSkyDown is 4th in my playlist, as the break down towards the middle of the song pulls the first portion up by the bootstraps







Edit: I had at first misrepresented what "chugs" were until Stephen Brazil @etotheeyepi corrected me.
